  abstract = {Rayleigh scattering ( RAY-lee), named after the 19th-century British physicist Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt), is the predominantly elastic scattering of light, or other electromagnetic radiation, by particles with a size much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. For light frequencies well below the resonance frequency of the scattering medium (normal dispersion regime), the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, e.g., a blue color is scattered much more than a red color as light propagates through air. Rayleigh scattering results from the electric polarizability of the particles. The oscillating electric field of a light wave acts on the charges within a particle, causing them to move at the same frequency. The particle, therefore, becomes a small radiating dipole whose radiation we see as scattered light. The particles may be individual atoms or molecules; it can occur when light travels through transparent solids and liquids, but is most prominently seen in gases. Rayleigh scattering of sunlight in Earth's atmosphere causes diffuse sky radiation, which is the reason for the blue color of the daytime and twilight sky, as well as the yellowish to reddish hue of the low Sun. Sunlight is also subject to Raman scattering, which changes the rotational state of the molecules and gives rise to polarization effects.Scattering by particles with a size comparable to, or larger than, the wavelength of the light is typically treated by the Mie theory, the discrete dipole approximation and other computational techniques. Rayleigh scattering applies to particles that are small with respect to wavelengths of light, and that are optically "soft" (i.e., with a refractive index close to 1). Anomalous diffraction theory applies to optically soft but larger particles.},

Surface water resources are threatened due to overpopulation in the city either qualitatively or quantitatively, also croplands are being lost with the development of urbanization activities through the city. To monitor and assess surface changes accurately, we classified the city area using satellite images of both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 and compared both of their findings. The Support Vector Machine classifier was applied to multi-senor data to classify four different land categories using the same training sites and samples with the same period. All the procedures were conducted in Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The surface reflectance bands of both satellites were used for classification. Confusion matrixes were created using the same reference points for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 classification to compare the results and determine the best approach for classification of land cover. Results show that overall accuracy was 94.26\% for Sentinel-2 while it was 85.04\% for Landsat-8, similarly, the Kappa coefficient was calculated 91.7\% and 78.3\% for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, respectively.},

  abstract = {Since the launch of Sentinel-1 mission, automated processing systems have been developed for near real-time monitoring of ground deformation signals. Here, we perform a regional analysis of 5 years over 64 volcanic centres located along the East African Rift System (EARS). We show that the correction of atmospheric signals for the arid and low-elevation EARS volcanoes is less important than for other volcanic environments. We find that the amplitude of the cumulative displacements exceeds three times the temporal noise of the time series (3σ) for 16 of the 64 volcanoes, which includes previously reported deformation signals, and two new ones at Paka and Silali volcanoes. From a 5-year times series, uncertainties in rates of deformation are ∼0.1 cm/yr, whereas uncertainties associated with the choice of reference pixel are typically 0.3–0.6 cm/yr. We fit the time series using simple functional forms and classify seven of the volcano time series as ‘linear’, six as ‘sigmoidal’ and three as ‘hybrid’, enabling us to discriminate between steady deformation and short-term pulses of deformation. This study provides a framework for routine volcano monitoring using InSAR on a continental scale. Here, we focus on Sentinel-1 data from the EARS, but the framework could be expanded to include other satellite systems or global coverage.},

  abstract = {An estimated 2.5–5 billion single-use coffee cups are disposed of annually in the UK, most of which consist of paper with a plastic lining. Due to the difficulty of recycling poly-coated material, most of these cups end up incinerated or put in landfills. As drinking (take-away) hot beverages is a behaviour, behaviour change interventions are necessary to reduce the environmental impacts of single-use coffee cup waste. Basing the design of interventions on a theoretical understanding of behaviour increases the transparency of the development process, the likelihood that the desired changes in behaviour will occur and the potential to synthesise findings across studies. The present paper presents a methodology for identifying influences on using single-use and reusable cups as a basis for designing intervention strategies. Two behaviour change frameworks: The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COMB) model of behaviour, were used to develop an online survey and follow-up interviews. Research findings can inform the selection of intervention strategies using a third framework, the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). The application of the methodology is illustrated in relation to understanding barriers and enablers to single-use and reusable cup use across the setting of a London university campus. We have developed a detailed method for identifying behavioural influences relevant to pro-environmental behaviours, together with practical guidance for each step and a worked example. Benefits of this work include it providing guidance on developing study materials and collecting and analysing data. We offer this methodology to the intervention development and implementation community to assist in the application of behaviour change theory to interventions.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) systems have been collecting massive volumes of datasets for decades, managing and analyzing of which are not practical using common software packages and desktop computing resources. In this regard, Google has developed a cloud computing platform, called Google Earth Engine (GEE), to effectively address the challenges of big data analysis. In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications, it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range of applications, such as Land Cover/land Use classification, hydrology, urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different fields to resolve their big data processing challenges.},

The variance in spectral, spatial image resolution, texture, colours, and complex physical shapes of informal urban settlements has made it difficult to provide accurate evidence for urban planners to achieve sustainable urban planning. In this article, the PRISMA methodology was used to thoroughly investigate various techniques used to classify informal settlements from satellite imagery between 2010 and 2021, as well as identify the methods' strengths and weaknesses, along with image indicators used in generating adequate information for sustainable urban planning. According to the study, the dominant models and approaches used to identify or detect informal settlements in satellite imagery for urban planning purposes are remote sensing, GIS, and artificial intelligence (machine learning) applications, as well as quantitative indicators. It was also revealed that without an integrated methodology, the proposed approaches used in different studies could not accurately detect and classify informal settlements. This is due to similarities in the texture of buildings of both formal and informal settlements, as well as variations in image spectral and spatial resolutions, as reported in previous studies.},

The visual tasks could be either image or video. Unlike the image processing, the difficulty of video processing is always a challenge due to changes in information over time variation. Significant performance improvements when applying deep learning algorithms to video processing. This paper presents a deep neural network based on ResNet50 model. The latter is conducted on the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) due to the variance of the nature of the data exists which is speech and song. The choice of ResNet model is based on the ability of facing different problems such as of vanishing gradients, the performing stability offered by this model, the ability of CNN for feature extraction which is considered to be the base architecture for ResNet, and the ability of improving the accuracy results and minimizing the loss. The achieved results are 57.73\% for song and 55.52\% for speech. Results shows that the Resnet50 model is suitable for both speech and song while maintaining performance stability.},

  abstract = {This paper builds on current research in desertification and approaches design to assist in the accurate measurement of desertification in both spatial (pixel level) and temporal scales taking cue from two earlier studies by Lampray in 1975 and Prince in 1998. These studies vary both in time and space, hinge on different perceptions which directed the methodological approach and conclusions, their points of divergence and convergence have proven to be the strength of many current desertification studies including this one. The focus of this study was to find an indicator-based based approach, i.e. Using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which can measure desertification in a continuum over long term. Whereas long–term and continuous analysis is important, this study finds that spatial pattern of land degradation in the UER differ from place to place and from time to time which may be attributed to land use types and intensity. The study therefore concludes that although the general surfaces appearance is important, localized land degradation and short term degradations are likely to be overlooked. Assessing desertification in continuum should reflect both temporal and spatial land degradation degradation trajectories. These trajectories have implications for identifying the cause or causes of degradation and developing targeted approach both at the regional and local levels. In the case of the UER, efforts at combating desertification would more likely be effective at locality level where decisions on land preparation, including the use of fire, the timing and the method of cultivation is likely to be effectively enforced.},

  abstract = {In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for timely, comprehensive global agricultural intelligence. Timely information on global crop production is indispensable for combating the growing stress on the world’s crop production and for securing both short-term and long-term stable and reliable supply of food. Global agriculture monitoring systems are critical to providing this kind of intelligence and global earth observations are an essential component of an effective global agricultural monitoring system as they offer timely, objective, global information on croplands distribution, crop development and conditions as the growing season progresses. The Global Agriculture Monitoring Project (GLAM), a joint NASA, USDA, UMD and SDSU initiative, has built a global agricultural monitoring system that provides the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) with timely, easily accessible, scientifically-validated remotely-sensed data and derived products as well as data analysis tools, for crop-condition monitoring and production assessment. This system is an integral component of the USDA’s FAS Decision Support System (DSS) for agriculture. It has significantly improved the FAS crop analysts’ ability to monitor crop conditions, and to quantitatively forecast crop yields through the provision of timely, high-quality global earth observations data in a format customized for FAS alongside a suite of data analysis tools. FAS crop analysts use these satellite data in a ‘convergence of evidence’ approach with meteorological data, field reports, crop models, attaché reports and local reports. The USDA FAS is currently the only operational provider of timely, objective crop production forecasts at the global scale. These forecasts are routinely used by the other US Federal government agencies as well as by commodity trading companies, farmers, relief agencies and foreign governments. This paper discusses the operational components and new developments of the GLAM monitoring system as well as the future role of earth observations in global agricultural monitoring.},

The results indicate that a significant portion of the fires related to violence were detected, and a relationship was found between increased fire detections and reported violence. However, underlying difficulties in the anecdotal reporting introduce uncertainties into the results.

  abstract = {Volcanoes in humid tropical environments are frequently cloud covered, typically densely vegetated and rapidly eroded. These factors complicate field and laboratory studies and even the basic identification of potentially active volcanoes. Numerous previous studies have highlighted the potential value of radar remote sensing for volcanology in equatorial regions. Here, cloud- and vegetation-penetrating LHH-band (λ≈24\,cm) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) are used to investigate persistently active volcanoes and prehistoric calderas in East Java, Indonesia. The LHH-band JERS-1 SAR produces high-spatial-resolution (18\,m) imagery with relatively high incidence angle that highlights structures and topographic variations at or greater than the wavelength scale while minimising geometrical distortions such as layover and foreshortening. These images, along with Internet browse data derived from the Canadian RADARSAT mission, provide new evidence relating regional tectonics to volcanism throughout East Java. Volcanic events, such as caldera collapse at the Tengger caldera, appear to have been partly controlled by northwest-aligned faults related to intra-arc sedimentary basins. Similar regional controls appear important at historically active Lamongan volcano, which is encircled by numerous flank maars and cinder cones. A previously undocumented pyroclastic sheet and debris avalanche deposit from the Jambangan caldera complex is also manifested in the synoptic radar images. At the currently active Semeru volcano these data permit identification of recent pyroclastic flow and lahar deposits. Radar data therefore offer a valuable tool for mapping and hazard assessment at late Quaternary volcanoes. The criteria developed in the analysis here could be applied to other regions in the humid tropics.},

  abstract = {The spatial and temporal monitoring of soil organic carbon (SOC), and other soil properties related to soil erosion, is extremely important, both from the environmental and economic perspectives. Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) time series increase the probability to observe bare soil fields in croplands, and thus, monitor soil properties over large regions. In this regard, this work suggests an automated pixel-based approach to select only pure soil pixels in S2 and L8 time series, and to make a synthetic bare soil image (SBSI). The SBSIs and the soil properties measured in the framework of the European LUCAS survey were used to calibrate SOC, clay, and CaCO3 prediction models. The results highlight a high correlation between laboratory soil spectra and the SBSIs median spectra, especially for the SBSI obtained by a three-year S2 collection, which provides satisfactory results in terms of SOC prediction accuracy (RPD: 1.74). The comparison between S2 and L8 results demonstrated the higher capability of the S2 sensor in terms of SOC prediction accuracy, mainly due to the greater spatial resolution of the bands in the visible region. Whereas, neither S2 nor L8 could accurately predict the clay and CaCO3 content. This is because of the low spectral and spatial resolution of their SWIR bands that prevent the exploitation of the narrow spectral features related to these two soil attributes. The results of this study prove that large S2 time series can estimate and monitor SOC in croplands using an automated pixel-based approach that selects pure soil pixels and retrieves reliable synthetic soil spectra.},

The correlation improved to some extent after taking account of the seasonal variation of scale height and the vertical distribution of aerosols. The correlation coefficient further improved significantly after considering the influencing factor of Relative Humidity (RH). This study concluded that satellite remote-sensing could serve as an efficient tool for monitoring the spatial distribution of particulate pollutants on the ground-level, as long as corrections have been made in the two aforementioned processes. Taking advantage of the MODIS information, we analyzed a pollution episode occurring in October 2004 in Beijing. It indicated that satellite remote-sensing could describe the formation process of the ground-level pollution episode in detail, and showed that regional transport and the topography were crucial factors to air quality in Beijing. The annual averaged distribution in the urban area of Beijing and its surroundings could be also obtained from the high-resolution retrieval results, implicating that high-resolution satellite remote-sensing might be potential in monitoring the source distribution of particulate pollutants.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new global burned area (BA) product, generated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) red (R) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectances and thermal anomaly data, thus providing the highest spatial resolution (approx. 250\&thinsp;m) among the existing global BA datasets. The product includes the full times series (2001–2016) of the Terra-MODIS archive. The BA detection algorithm was based on monthly composites of daily images, using temporal and spatial distance to active fires. The algorithm has two steps, the first one aiming to reduce commission errors by selecting the most clearly burned pixels (seeds), and the second one targeting to reduce omission errors by applying contextual analysis around the seed pixels. This product was developed within the European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme, under the Fire Disturbance project (Fire\_cci). The final output includes two types of BA files: monthly full-resolution continental tiles and biweekly global grid files at a degraded resolution of 0.25∘. Each set of products includes several auxiliary variables that were defined by the climate users to facilitate the ingestion of the product into global dynamic vegetation and atmospheric emission models. Average annual burned area from this product was 3.81\&thinsp;Mkm2, with maximum burning in 2011 (4.1\&thinsp;Mkm2) and minimum in 2013 (3.24\&thinsp;Mkm2). The validation was based on a stratified random sample of 1200 pairs of Landsat images, covering the whole globe from 2003 to 2014. The validation indicates an overall accuracy of 0.9972, with much higher errors for the burned than the unburned category (global omission error of BA was estimated as 0.7090 and global commission as 0.5123). These error values are similar to other global BA products, but slightly higher than the NASA BA product (named MCD64A1, which is produced at 500\&thinsp;m resolution). However, commission and omission errors are better compensated in our product, with a tendency towards BA underestimation (relative bias −0.4033), as most existing global BA products. To understand the value of this product in detecting small fire patches (\&lt;100\&thinsp;ha), an additional validation sample of 52 Sentinel-2 scenes was generated specifically over Africa. Analysis of these results indicates a better detection accuracy of this product for small fire patches (\&lt;100\&thinsp;ha) than the equivalent 500\&thinsp;m MCD64A1 product, although both have high errors for these small fires. Examples of potential applications of this dataset to fire modelling based on burned patches analysis are included in this paper. The datasets are freely downloadable from the Fire\_cci website (https://www.esa-fire-cci.org/, last access: 10 November 2018) and their repositories (pixel at full resolution: https://doi.org/cpk7, and grid: https://doi.org/gcx9gf).},

  title = {Time {{Series Generation}} and {{Classification}} of {{MODIS Data}} for {{Land Cover Mapping}}},
  author = {Colditz, Rene},
  date = {2008-01-22},
  abstract = {Processes of the Earths surface occur at different scales of time and intensity. Climate in particular determines the activity and seasonal development of vegetation. These dynamics are predominantly driven by temperature in the humid mid-latitudes and by the availability of water in semi-arid regions. Human activities are a modifying parameter for many ecosystems and can become the prime force in well-developed regions with an intensively managed environment. Accounting for these dynamics, i.e. seasonal dynamics of ecosystems and short- to long-term changes in land-cover composition, requires multiple measurements in time. With respect to the characterization of the Earth surface and its transformation due to global warming and human-induced global change, there is a need for appropriate data and methods to determine the activity of vegetation and the change of land cover. Space-borne remote sensing is capable of monitoring the activity and development of vegetation as well as changes of the land surface. In many instances, satellite images are the only means to comprehensively assess the surface characteristics of large areas. A high temporal frequency of image acquisition, forming a time series of satellite data, can be employed for mapping the development of vegetation in space and time. Time series allow for detecting and assessing changes and multi-year transformation processes of high and low intensity, or even abrupt events such as fire and flooding. The operational processing of satellite data and automated information-extraction techniques are the basis for consistent and continuous long-term product generation. This provides the potential for directly using remote-sensing data and products for analyzing the land surface in relation to global warming and global change, including deforestation and land transformation. This study aims at the development of an advanced approach to time-series generation using data-quality indicators. A second goal focuses on the application of time series for automated land-cover classification and update, using fractional cover estimates to accommodate for the comparatively coarse spatial resolution. Requirements of this study are the robustness and high accuracy of the approaches as well as the full transferability to other regions and datasets. In this respect, the developments of this study form a methodological framework, which can be filled with appropriate modules for a specific sensor and application. In order to attain the first goal, time-series compilation, a stand-alone software application called TiSeG (Time Series Generator) has been developed. TiSeG evaluates the pixel-level quality indicators provided with each MODIS land product. It computes two important data-availability indicators, the number of invalid pixels and the maximum gap length. Both indices are visualized in time and space, indicating the feasibility of temporal interpolation. The level of desired data quality can be modified spatially and temporally to account for distinct environments in a larger study area and for seasonal differences. Pixels regarded as invalid are either masked or interpolated with spatial or temporal techniques. Prozesse an der Erdoberfläche finden auf verschiedenen Intensitätsskalen und in unterschiedlichen Zeiträumen statt. Dabei steuert das Klima die saisonale Aktivität der Vegetation, welche in den humiden Mittelbreiten hauptsächlich durch die Temperatur bestimmt wird. In semi-ariden Gebieten hingegen ist die Verfügbarkeit von Wasser als Haupteinflussfaktor für das Pflanzenwachstum zu betrachten. Andererseits greift auch der Mensch modifizierend in das Ökosystem ein. Dies gilt insbesondere für die stark besiedelten und intensiver genutzten Räume der Erde, in denen die Umwelt nahezu ausschließlich durch den Menschen gesteuert wird. Zur Beurteilung dieser Dynamiken, sowohl der natürlichen saisonalen Muster als auch der kurz- bis langfristigen Änderungen der Landschaft, ist die Aufnahme einer Vielzahl von Messungen über eine längere Periode erforderlich. Insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit der Charakterisierung der Landoberfläche und deren Veränderung im Rahmen der Erderwärmung aber auch des wachsenden Einflusses des Menschen auf die Umwelt besteht somit ein Bedarf an geeigneten Daten und Methoden zur Bestimmung der jährlichen Aktivität von Vegetationseinheiten und der wiederholbaren Kartierung der Landoberfläche. Die Satellitenfernerkundung ist in der Lage, durch Messung von Strahlung die Aktivität der Vegetation zu bestimmen sowie die Klassifikation der Landoberfläche abzuleiten. In vielen Fällen sind Satellitenaufnahmen die einzige Möglichkeit, große Flächen der Erde umfassend und einheitlich zu beurteilen. Dabei kann durch eine Vielzahl aufeinander folgender Aufnahmen, d.h. eine Zeitreihe aus Satellitendaten, die Entwicklung der Vegetation in Raum und Zeit beobachtet werden. Zeitreihen bieten das Potential, Veränderungen der Landoberfläche über mehrere Jahre zu dokumentieren und somit Prozesse sowohl hoher als auch niedriger Intensität abzuleiten. Neben diesen gerichteten Veränderungen können auch plötzliche Ereignisse, wie z.B. Hochwasser oder Brände, mit Zeitreihen erfasst und in Bezug auf normale Bedingungen ausgewertet werden. Insbesondere die operationelle Prozessierung der Satellitendaten und die automatisierte Ableitung von Informationen bilden die Basis für konsistente und kontinuierliche Produkte über längere Zeiträume. Somit besteht das Potential, die Ergebnisse direkt in die Erforschung der Landoberfläche und deren Veränderung, z.B. durch die Erderwärmung, Walddegradation, oder die Nutzung vormals natürlicher Flächen, einzubinden. Diese Dissertation befasst sich mit der Entwicklung von Methoden zur Zeitreihengenerierung unter Verwendung der Qualitätsindikatoren einzelner Aufnahmen. Ein zweites Ziel der Arbeit ist die Anwendung der optimierten Zeitreihen zur automatisierten und reproduzierbaren Kartierung der Landoberfläche, wobei unscharfe Klassifikationsverfahren zur genaueren Charakterisierung der räumlich nur grob aufgelösten Daten eingesetzt werden. Damit erfordert diese Arbeit sowohl Robustheit der eingesetzten Methoden als auch eine hohe Genauigkeit der Ergebnisse. Ebenso maßgeblich ist die Übertragbarkeit der Verfahren, einerseits auf verschiedene Regionen als auch auf verschiedene Datensätze. Daher sind die hier vorgenommenen Entwicklungen als ein Rahmen zu verstehen, der je nach Sensor oder Anwendung mit verschiedenen Modulen besetzt werden kann. Zum Erreichen des ersten Zieles, der Zeitreihengenerierung, wurde das eigenständige Softwareprodukt TiSeG (Time Series Generator) entwickelt. TiSeG dient der Auswertung der Qualitätsindikatoren die mit jedem MODIS-Produkt für terrestrische Applikationen zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Dabei werden in Bezug auf die Generierung von Zeitreihen zwei Indizes der Datenverfügbarkeit ermittelt: erstens die Anzahl der ungültigen Pixel und zweitens die längste zeitliche Datenlücke. Beide Indizes werden räumlich und zeitlich dargestellt und geben so dem Bearbeiter die Information, ob mit den aktuellen Qualitätsangaben die Generierung einer sinnvollen Zeitreihe durch zeitliche Dateninterpolation möglich ist. Die Qualitätseinstellungen können sowohl zeitlich als auch räumlich angepasst werden. Eine zeitliche Änderung kann beispielsweise für bestimmte Jahreszeiten sinnvoll sein. Räumlich unterschiedliche Qualitätseinstellungen eignen sich für größere Untersuchungsgebiete mit differenzierten physisch-geographischen Charakteristika. Als ungültig betrachtete Pixel können durch einen Fehlwert maskiert oder durch zeitliche und räumliche Interpolation neu errechnet werden. Das zweite Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die automatische Klassifikation von Zeitreihen. Hierzu wurde ein modulares Verfahren der überwachten Klassifikation entwickelt. Aufgrund der groben räumlichen Auflösung von MODIS-Daten erschien es besonders wichtig, ein unscharfes Verfahren aufzubauen, das die Heterogenität der Klassen in vielen Räumen besser abbilden kann. Dabei wurde der Klassenanteil eines jeden Pixel ermittelt. Die Schlüsselmodule zur erfolgreichen Durchführung der Klassifikation waren eine Multiskalenanalyse und die geeignete Auswahl von Merkmalen und Stichproben zum Trainieren des Klassifikators. Der eigentliche Klassifikationsschritt wurde durch eine Erweiterung des Entscheidungsbaumklassifikators durchgeführt. Diese Erweiterung kann in den bestehenden Rahmen von random forest und bagging (ein Akronym für bootstrap aggregation) eingeordnet werden. Jedoch wurden die dort angewendeten Verfahren in dieser Arbeit zu einem deutlich strategischen Vorgehen modifiziert, d.h. es wurde auf das Prinzip der Zufallsauswahl und der Wiederverwendung von Stichproben (Ziehen mit Zurücklegen) verzichtet. In Bezug auf die anfangs geschilderten Anforderungen, Robustheit, Genauigkeit und Übertragbarkeit, kann an dieser Stelle festgestellt werden, dass sich die in dieser Arbeit entwickelten Methodiken als geeignet erwiesen haben. Insbesondere die Übertragbarkeit auf andere Regionen und Daten war eine große Herausforderung, da hierdurch kein zusätzliches a priori Wissen außer den Trainingsdaten zum überwachten Klassifizieren benutzt werden konnte. Die regionale Übertragbarkeit ist für mehrere Untersuchungsräume mit sehr unterschiedlichen physisch-geographischen Eigenschaften demonstriert worden. Obwohl TiSeG derzeit nicht direkt auf andere Datensätze außer MODIS angewendet wird, bildet die zugrunde liegende Idee der Auswertung von Qualitätsdaten zur Zeitreihengenerierung sowie der entwickelte Rahmen der Software die Möglichkeit der Erweiterung, z.B. auf Daten von MERIS und auf das zukünftige VIIRS-Instrument. Des Weiteren ist das grundlegende Konzept der Qualitätsauswertung in einem separaten Prozessor für AVHRR NDVI Daten zu einem vollautomatischen, schrittweise interpolierenden Verfahren erweitert worden. Das in dieser Arbeit vorgestellte modulare Klassifikationsverfahren erfordert keine besonderen Eingangsdaten, wie z.B. bestimmte MODIS Zeitreihen. Dies wurde durch den Gebrauch unterschiedlicher Eingangsdaten zur Generierung der Maßzahlen bei der Sensitivitätsanalyse bestätigt. Damit ist der Prozess weder auf MODIS-Zeitserien noch auf Zeitreihen generell beschränkt. Der gesamte automatische Klassifikationsprozess ist datengesteuert, sowohl was die zu klassifizierenden Daten als auch die Trainingsdaten angeht. Die Unschärfe in den Ergebnissen ermöglicht die detaillierte Auswertung der Klassenzusammensetzung, was ein besonders wichtiger Aspekt bei grob aufgelösten Datenprodukten und deren Anpassungsfähigkeit auf andere Anwendungen ist.}

Thus, the continuous monitoring and mapping of wetlands is necessary for observing effects of climate change and ensuring a healthy environment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing satellites are active remote sensing instruments essential for monitoring wetlands, given the possibility to bypass the cloud-sensitive optical instruments and obtain satellite imagery day and night. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the basic concepts of SAR remote sensing technology and its applications for wetland monitoring and mapping. Emphasis is given to SAR systems with full and compact polarimetric SAR capabilities. Brief discussions on the latest state-of-the-art wetland applications using SAR imagery are presented. Also, we summarize the current trends in wetland monitoring and mapping using SAR imagery.

In this paper, the desertification change patterns between 2000 and 2015 were identified by operating the classification and regression tree (CART) method with multisource remote sensing datasets on Google Earth Engine (GEE), which has the higher overall accuracy (85\%) than three other methods, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and Albedo-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) models. A contribution index of climate change and human activities on desertification was introduced to quantitatively explicate the driving mechanisms of desertification change based on the temporal datasets and net primary productivity (NPP). The results show that the area of slight desertification land had increased from 719,700 km2 to 948,000 km2 between 2000 and 2015. The area of severe desertification land decreased from 82,400 km2 to 71,200 km2. The area of desertification increased by 9.68\%, in which 69.68\% was mainly caused by human activities. Climate change and human activities accounted for 68.8\% and 27.36\%, respectively, in the area of desertification restoration. In general, the degree of desertification showed a decreasing trend, and climate change was the major driving factor in the CMREC area between 2000 and 2015.},

A MODIS NDVI dataset (2000–2015) and five LANDSAT images (1986–2012) were used to identify spatial and temporal dynamics and to emphasize areas of greater degradation. The study indicates that the land clearing found by previous investigations in the second part of the 20th century is still ongoing, with a decreasing trend of MODIS NDVI values recorded in the period 2000–2015. This trend appeared to be linked to an increase in bare soil areas that was demonstrated by analysis of LANDSAT SAVI images. The investigation also indicated that rates of degradation are stronger in more deteriorated areas like those located nearer Niamey; degradation patterns also tend to increase from the inner areas to the edges of the plateau. These results attest to the urgency to develop effective environmental preservation policies and find alternative solutions for domestic energy supply.},

MODIS has 10 products dedicated mainly to land cover characterization and provides three kinds of data: angular, spectral and temporal. MODIS data also includes information about the data quality through the ‘Quality Assessment’ product. In this paper, we review how MODIS data are used to map land cover including the preferred MODIS products, the preprocessing and classification approaches, the accuracy assessment, and the results obtained.},

In order to deliver effective economic and social aid, non-government organizations (NGOs), such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), require detailed maps of the locations of informal settlements. However, data regarding informal and formal settlements is primarily unavailable and if available is often incomplete. This is due, in part, to the cost and complexity of gathering data on a large scale. To address these challenges, we, in this work, provide three contributions. 1) A brand new machine learning data-set, purposely developed for informal settlement detection. 2) We show that it is possible to detect informal settlements using freely available low-resolution (LR) data, in contrast to previous studies that use very-high resolution (VHR) ∗Both authors contributed equally to this research.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

  abstract = {The Center for Space Research (CSR), in conjunction with the Monitoring Operations Division (MOD) of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), is evaluating the use of remotely sensed satellite data to assist in monitoring and predicting air quality in Texas. The challenges of meeting air quality standards established by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) are impacted by the transport of pollution into Texas that originates from outside our borders and are cumulative with those generated by local sources. In an attempt to quantify the concentrations of all pollution sources, MOD has installed ground-based monitoring stations in rural regions along the Texas geographic boundaries including the Gulf coast, as well as urban regions that are the predominant sources of domestic pollution. However, analysis of time-lapse GOES satellite imagery at MOD, clearly demonstrates the shortcomings of using only ground-based observations for monitoring air quality across Texas. These shortcomings include the vastness of State borders, that can only be monitored with a large number of ground-based sensors, and gradients in pollution concentration that depend upon the location of the point source, the meteorology governing its transport to Texas, and its diffusion across the region. With the launch of NASA's MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the transport of aerosol-borne pollutants can now be monitored over land and ocean surfaces. Thus, CSR and MOD personnel have applied MODIS data to several classes of pollution that routinely impact Texas air quality. Results demonstrate MODIS data and products can detect and track the migration of pollutants. This paper presents one case study in which continental haze from the northeast moved into the region and subsequently required health advisories to be issued for 150 counties in Texas. It is concluded that MODIS provides the basis for developing advanced data products that will, when used in conjunction with ground-based observations, create a cost-effective and accurate pollution monitoring system for the entire state of Texas.},

  abstract = {Ocean colour (OC) remote sensing is important for monitoring marine ecosystems. However, inverting the OC signal from the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance measured by satellite sensors remains a challenge as the retrieval accuracy is highly dependent on the performance of the atmospheric correction as well as sensor calibration. In this study, the performances of four atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms, the Atmospheric and Radiometric Correction of Satellite Imagery (ARCSI), Atmospheric Correction for OLI ‘lite’ (ACOLITE), Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance (LSR) Climate Data Record (Landsat CDR), herein referred to as LaSRC (Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Code), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), implemented for Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, were evaluated. The OLI-derived remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) products (also known as Level-2 products) were tested against near-simultaneous in-situ data acquired from the OC component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC). Analyses of the match-ups revealed that generic atmospheric correction methods (i.e., ARCSI and LaSRC), which perform reasonably well over land, provide inaccurate Level-2 products over coastal waters, in particular, in the blue bands. Between water-specific AC methods (i.e., SeaDAS and ACOLITE), SeaDAS was found to perform better over complex waters with root-mean-square error (RMSE) varying from 0.0013 to 0.0005 sr−1 for the 443 and 655 nm channels, respectively. An assessment of the effects of dominant environmental variables revealed AC retrieval errors were influenced by the solar zenith angle and wind speed for ACOLITE and SeaDAS in the 443 and 482 nm channels. Recognizing that the AERONET-OC sites are not representative of inland waters, extensive research and analyses are required to further evaluate the performance of various AC methods for high-resolution imagers like Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 under a broad range of aquatic/atmospheric conditions.},

  abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is inherent to remotely sensed data. Nearby pixels are more similar than distant ones. This property can help to improve the classification performance, by adding spatial or contextual features into the model. However, it can also lead to overestimation of generalisation capabilities, if the spatial dependence between training and test sets is ignored. In this paper, we review existing approaches that deal with spatial autocorrelation for image classification in remote sensing and demonstrate the importance of bias in accuracy metrics when spatial independence between the training and test sets is not respected. We compare three spatial and non-spatial cross-validation strategies at pixel and object levels and study how performances vary at different sample sizes. Experiments based on Sentinel-2 data for mapping two simple forest classes show that spatial leave-one-out cross-validation is the better strategy to provide unbiased estimates of predictive error. Its performance metrics are consistent with the real quality of the resulting map contrary to traditional non-spatial cross-validation that overestimates accuracy. This highlight the need to change practices in classification accuracy assessment. To encourage it we developped Museo ToolBox, an open-source python library that makes spatial cross-validation possible.},

Recently, the regression discontinuity design (RD) has become a popular type of natural experiment due to its relatively weak assumptions. We study a special type of regression discontinuity design where the discontinuity in treatment assignment is geographic. In this design, which we call the Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design, a geographic or administrative boundary splits units into treated and control areas, and analysts make the case that the division into treated and control areas occurs in an as-if random fashion. We show how this design is equivalent to a standard RD with two running variables, but we also clarify several methodological differences that arise in geographical contexts. We also offer a method for estimation of geographically located treatment effects that can also be used to validate the identification assumptions using observable pretreatment characteristics. We illustrate our methodological framework with a re-examination of the effects of political advertisements on voter turnout during a presidential campaign, exploiting the exogenous variation in the volume of presidential ads that is created by media market boundaries.},

This study was undertaken to investigate the usage patterns of the Google Earth Engine platform and whether researchers in developing countries were making use of the opportunity. Analysis of published literature showed that a total of 300 journal papers were published between 2011 and June 2017 that used GEE in their research, spread across 158 journals. The highest number of papers were in the journal Remote Sensing, followed by Remote Sensing of Environment. There were also a number of papers in premium journals such as Nature and Science. The application areas were quite varied, ranging from forest and vegetation studies to medical fields such as malaria. Landsat was the most widely used dataset; it is the biggest component of the GEE data portal, with data from the first to the current Landsat series available for use and download. Examination of data also showed that the usage was dominated by institutions based in developed nations, with study sites mainly in developed nations. There were very few studies originating from institutions based in less developed nations and those that targeted less developed nations, particularly in the African continent.},

In this paper, the Hogno Khaan protected area in Mongolia was selected as the study area, and a quantitative method for assessing land cover change and desertification assessment was developed using Landsat TM/ETM+ data on a local scale. In this method, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), TGSI (Topsoil Grain Size Index), and land surface albedo were selected as indicators for representing land surface conditions from vegetation biomass, landscape pattern, and micrometeorology. A Decision Tree (DT) approach was used to assess the land cover change and desertification of the Hogno Khaan protected area in 1990, 2002, and 2011. Our analysis showed no correlation between NDVI and albedo or TGSI but high correlation between TGSI and albedo. Strong correlations (0.77–0.92) between TGSI and albedo were found in the non-desertification areas. The TGSI was less strongly correlated with albedo in the low and non desertification areas, at 0.70 and 0.92; respectively. The desertification of the study area is increasing each year; in the desertification map for 1990–2002, there is a decrease in areas of zero and low desertification, and an increase in areas of high and severe desertification. From 2002 to 2011, areas of non desertification increased significantly, with areas of severe desertification also exhibiting increase, while areas of medium and high desertification demonstrated little change.},

  abstract = {The fluctuation of vegetation water condition around desert area is one of most important parameters to interpret the desertification expansion. United Nations reported that about 35 million square kilometers of land are subject to desertification. Historically, many parts of China have been suffered from severe desertification. This paper attempts an analysis for spatio-temporal variation characteristics of vegetation drought status around China and Mongolia desert with remotely sensed data. Time series images (1 January, 1999 - 31 December 2006) obtained from SPOT/VEGETATION were used to monitor inter-annual variability of water condition. SPOT/VEGETATION satellite, which has a fine temporal resolution and sensitive to vegetation growth, could be very useful to detect large scale dynamics of environmental changes and desertification progress. The main objective of the study is analyzing water status around China and Mongolia desert and predicting a risk area of desertification. In this study, NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) is used to monitor vegetation water condition (drought status) over the study area. To interpret the relationship between vegetation drought status and vigor, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) was employed in ensemble with NDWI. Annual total precipitation from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data is used as subsidiary data. The study area from 73°36´E to 120°41´E longitude and from 30°81´N to 52°13´N longitude in northern China and whole Mongolia. NDWI value around desert has a range from -0.05 to -0.35 and NDWI values are decreased during the study period. Each year precipitation patterns are similar to yearly mean NDWI value. The study detected several areas where NDWI is dramatically decreased for 8 years, especially northeast part of Mongolian Gobi desert and southeast part of China Taklamakan desert.},

  abstract = {Heretofore, global Burned Area (BA) products have only been available at coarse spatial resolution, since most of the current global BA products are produced with the help of active fire detection or dense time-series change analysis, which requires very high temporal resolution. In this study, however, we focus on an automated global burned area mapping approach based on Landsat images. By utilizing the huge catalog of satellite imagery, as well as the high-performance computing capacity of Google Earth Engine, we propose an automated pipeline for generating 30-m resolution global-scale annual burned area maps from time-series of Landsat images, and a novel 30-m resolution Global annual Burned Area Map of 2015 (GABAM 2015) was released. All the available Landsat-8 images during 2014–2015 and various spectral indices were utilized to calculate the burned probability of each pixel using random decision forests, which were globally trained with stratified (considering both fire frequency and type of land cover) samples, and a seed-growing approach was conducted to shape the final burned areas after several carefully-designed logical filters (NDVI filter, Normalized Burned Ratio (NBR) filter, and temporal filter). GABAM 2015 consists of spatial extent of fires that occurred during 2015 and not of fires that occurred in previous years. Cross-comparison with the recent Fire\_cci Version 5.0 BA product found a similar spatial distribution and a strong correlation ( R 2 = 0.74) between the burned areas from the two products, although differences were found in specific land cover categories (particularly in agriculture land). Preliminary global validation showed the commission and omission errors of GABAM 2015 to be 13.17\% and 30.13\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {We assessed tree cover using random points and polygons distributed within the administrative boundaries of Detroit, MI and Atlanta, GA. Two approaches were tested, a point-based approach using 1000 randomly located sample points, and polygon-based approach using 250 circular areas, 200m in radius (12.56ha). In the case of Atlanta, both approaches arrived at similar estimates of tree cover (50–53\%) for both time periods, yet they show that roughly one-third of the tree-covered land area in 1951 was also tree-covered in 2010 and about 30–31\% of the sampled land area lacked tree cover during both assessment periods. In the case of Detroit, the two approaches resulted in different estimates of tree cover (19.6\% vs. 30.8\% in 2010), yet similar levels of transitions over time. The only similarities between the two cities were that about 15–20\% of each city’s land area was covered with trees in 1951, yet lacked tree cover in 2010. While the polygon-based approach to estimating tree cover may result in a product that more explicitly represents covered areas, the point-based approach is recommended due to the time and effort involved with the polygon-based approach and potential error introduced through topographic displacement of trees and shadows. Overall, canopy cover over time remained stable while distribution varied greatly. However, while multi-decade change in aggregate is undetectable at the scale of a city, there seems to be substantial shifts in the spatial arrangement of the tree canopy.},

Research has demonstrated that Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to satellite imagery holds promise for automated detection of war-related building destruction. While these results are promising, monitoring in real-world applications requires consistently high precision, especially when destruction is sparse and detecting destroyed buildings is equivalent to looking for a needle in a haystack. We demonstrate that exploiting the persistent nature of building destruction can substantially improve the training of automated destruction monitoring. We also propose an additional machine learning stage that leverages images of surrounding areas and multiple successive images of the same area which further improves detection significantly. By combining these steps, we construct an automated classification of building destruction which allows real-world applications and we illustrate this in the context of the Syrian civil war.},

  abstract = {The objective of atmospheric correction is to retrieve surface reflectance from the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. However, estimating surface reflectance from the TOA reflectance satellite data requires knowledge about the state of the atmosphere (e.g., water vapor and ozone) and the contribution of aerosols to the atmospheric path radiance. Thus, obtaining precise measurements of these parameters, which is very difficult, is crucial for accurate estimation of surface reflectance. The SREM (Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation Method) is a physical-based atmospheric correction method based on the Radiative transfer (RT) equations of the second simulation of the Satellite Signal in Solar Spectrum (6SV). Essentially the SREM is a simplified version of 6SV which does not require Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), aerosol type, water vapor, and ozone. An initial study showed accuracy comparable to the Landsat operational Surface Reflectance Products (SRProd) which is generated through different RT models using AOD, water vapor, and ozone data. To further validate the SREM under varying atmospheric conditions and at different spatial resolutions, an independent Reference Surface Reflectance (SRRef) dataset was generated using the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) measurements as input to the 6SV RT model. The surface reflectances estimated by SREM (SRSREM) and SRProd from Planet Scope (PS, at 3~m spatial resolution), Sentinel-2 AB (S2AB) Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI, at 10 to 60~m spatial resolution), and Landsat-8 (L8) operational Land Imager (OLI, at 30~m spatial resolution) were validated against SRRef. Results showed that SRSREM performed similar to the SRProd of PS, S2AB MSI, and L8 OLI against SRRef. An inferior performance (R of 0.35 and 0.57) of L8 OLI's SRProd in the coastal blue (SB1) and blue (SB2) bands was observed, compared to SREM. The comparison of SRSREM with SRProd reveals the robustness of SREM, without using AOD, water vapor, and ozone data, for estimation of surface reflectance for all RT models tested. For some dates, SRRef and the SRProd under-corrected and produced higher values than the TOA reflectance, even when the atmosphere was clear but this was not the case for SREM. Analysis of surface reflectance estimation in shadowed areas revealed that the SRRef and SRProd had mainly negative values in coastal blue and blue bands for L8 OLI, while no negative SR value was observed for SREM in any band. These results recommend the utilization of SREM for the provision of surface reflectance products across a range of sensors},

A sugarscape model consisting of a cellular landscape of resources is used to form an interaction among the agents of the population. In the model, agents find the resources to survive. They are supposed to move and search and because of this movement, an evolutionary social behavior will develope. From model analysis view point this behavior should be parameterized and also optimized. To analyze the said assumption, each agent should gather and store as much sugar as possible to create an asset for itself. Hence, From the simulation result, the population be categorized based on the asset. In the society, wealth may be allocated based on the asset, gathered by the agents. The percentage of population who will possesses some percentage of the wealth is specified. The simulation shows that in an artificial life, it is possible to use the sugarscape model to optimize the behavior of a society, and the parameters of the model are predictable as well.},

  abstract = {Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross‐validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross‐validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non‐causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross‐validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non‐random and blocked cross‐validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross‐validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross‐validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross‐validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.},

  abstract = {Green space is any green infrastructure consisting of vegetation. Green space is linked with improving mental and physical health, providing opportunities for social interactions and physical activities, and aiding the environment. The quality of green space refers to the condition of the green space. Past machine learning-based studies have emphasized that littering, lack of maintenance, and dirtiness negatively impact the perceived quality of green space. These methods assess green spaces and their qualities without considering the human perception of green spaces. Domain-based methods, on the other hand, are labour-intensive, time-consuming, and challenging to apply to large-scale areas. This research proposes to build, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning methodology for assessing the quality of green space at a human-perception level using transfer learning on pre-trained models. The results indicated that the developed models achieved high scores across six performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen’s Kappa, and Average ROC-AUC. Moreover, the models were evaluated for their file size and inference time to ensure practical implementation and usage. The research also implemented Grad-CAM as means of evaluating the learning performance of the models using heat maps. The best-performing model, ResNet50, achieved 98.98\% accuracy, 98.98\% precision, 98.98\% recall, 99.00\% F1-score, a Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.98, and an Average ROC-AUC of 1.00. The ResNet50 model has a relatively moderate file size and was the second quickest to predict. Grad-CAM visualizations show that ResNet50 can precisely identify areas most important for its learning. Finally, the ResNet50 model was deployed on the Streamlit cloud-based platform as an interactive web application.},

  abstract = {Properties of multi-temporal ERS-1/2 tandem coherence in boreal forests and retrieval accuracy of forest stem volume have been investigated mostly for small, managed forest areas. The clear seasonal trends and the high accuracy of the retrieval are therefore valid for specific types of forest and question is if these findings extend to large areas with different forest types in a similar manner. Using multi-temporal ERS-1/2 coherence data and extensive sets of inventory data at stand level at seven forest compartments in Central Siberia we confirm that the trend of coherence as a function of stem volume is mainly driven by the environmental conditions at acquisition. In addition, we have now found that the variability of the coherence for a given stem volume are due to spatial variations of the environmental conditions, strong topography (slope{$>$}10°), small stand size ({$<$}3–4~ha) and low relative stocking ({$<$}50\%). Further deviations can be related to errors in the ground data. Stem volume retrieval behaves consistently under stable winter frozen conditions. For stands larger than 3–4~ha and relative stocking of at least 50\%, a relative RMSE of 20–25\% can be considered the effective retrieval error achievable in Siberian boreal forest. Combined with previous experience from managed test forests in Sweden and Finland, C-band ERS-1/2 tandem coherence observations acquired under stable winter conditions with a snow cover and an at least moderate breeze can be considered so far the most suitable spaceborne remote sensing observable for the estimation of forest stem volume in homogeneous forest stands throughout the boreal zone.},

  abstract = {The availability and accessibility of multispectral and radar satellite remote sensing (SRS) imagery are at an unprecedented high. These data have both become standard source of information for investigating species ecology and ecosystems structure, composition and function at large scales. Since they capture complementary aspects of the Earth's surface, synergies between these two types of imagery have the potential to greatly expand research and monitoring opportunities. However, despite the benefits of combining multispectral and radar SRS data, data fusion techniques, including image fusion, are not commonly used in biodiversity monitoring, ecology and conservation. To help close this application gap, we provide for the first time an overview of the most common SRS data fusion techniques, discussing their benefits and drawbacks, and pull together case studies illustrating the added value for biodiversity research and monitoring. Integrating and fusing multispectral and radar images can significantly improve our ability to assess the distribution as well as the horizontal and vertical structure of ecosystems. Additionally, SRS data fusion has the potential to increase opportunities for mapping species distribution and community composition, as well as for monitoring threats to biodiversity. Uptake of these techniques will benefit from more effective collaboration between remote sensing and biodiversity experts, making the reporting of methodologies more transparent, expanding SRS image processing capacity and promoting widespread open access to satellite imagery. In the context of a global biodiversity crisis, being able to track subtle changes in the biosphere across adequate spatial and temporal extents and resolutions is crucial. By making key parameter estimates derived from SRS data more accurate, SRS data fusion promises to become a powerful tool to help address current monitoring needs, and could support the development of essential biodiversity variables.},

  abstract = {A knowledge of the characteristics of urban green spaces (UGSs) such as their abundance, spatial distribution and species composition, has an important role in a range of fields such as urban geography, urban planning and public health. Remote sensing technologies have made great contributions to the analysis of UGSs. However, a comprehensive review of the current status, challenges and potential in this area is lacking. In this paper, we scrutinize major trends in remote sensing approaches for characterising UGSs and evaluate the effectiveness of different remote sensing systems and analytical techniques. The results suggest that the number of studies focusing on mapping UGSs and classifying species within UGSs have increased rapidly over recent decades. However, there are fewer examples of non-tree species mapping, change detection, biomass and carbon mapping and vegetation health assessment within UGSs. Most studies have focused on UGSs (mainly trees) which cover large areal extents, with fewer studies of smaller patches such as street trees, urban gardens, recreational spaces and public parks, even though collectively such patches can cover substantial areas. Hence, we encourage future investigations to focus on a wider variety of different UGSs, particularly small-scale UGSs. We also recommend that research focuses on developing more effective image time series analysis techniques, methods to capture the complexity of UGSs and the use of SAR in studies of UGSs. At the same time, further research is needed to fully exploit remote sensing data within thematic applications such as monitoring changes in UGSs over time, quantifying biomass and carbon mapping and assessing vegetation health.},

It takes 16 days for the swaths to overlap enough to image the whole Earth.Previous Landsat sensors swept back and forth across the swath like a whisk broom to collect data. The sensor looked at a calibration source at the end of every row, which means that measurements were consistent from orbit to orbit. But this sensor design requires fast-moving parts, which are more likely to break.—and which did on Landsat 7.In contrast, the instruments on Landsat 8 view across the entire swath at once, building strips of data like a pushbroom. This approach requires no moving parts and gives the sensor detectors greater dwell time. The pushbroom instrument is smaller and lighter than previous whisk broom instruments, but its calibration is much more complex given the large number of detectors.“It was a natural step to evolve to a pushbroom sensor. The technology was proven on other satellites, and we knew we could get better accuracy. The pushbroom has no moving parts. It is a newer and more reliable technology.” explains Terry Arvidson, senior project engineer.For more information on the future of Landsat instruments, read https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-9/instruments/. ||},

However, identifying specific crop types, cropland, and cropping patterns using space-based observations is challenging because different crop types and cropping patterns have similarity spectral signatures. This study applied a methodology to identify cropland and specific crop types, including tobacco, wheat, barley, and gram, as well as the following cropping patterns: wheat-tobacco, wheat-gram, wheat-barley, and wheat-maize, which are common in Gujranwala District, Pakistan, the study region. The methodology consists of combining optical remote sensing images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 with Machine Learning (ML) methods, namely a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) and a Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The best time-periods for differentiating cropland from other land cover types were identified, and then Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 NDVI-based time-series were linked to phenological parameters to determine the different crop types and cropping patterns over the study region using their temporal indices and ML algorithms. The methodology was subsequently evaluated using Landsat images, crop statistical data for 2020 and 2021, and field data on cropping patterns. The results highlight the high level of accuracy of the methodological approach presented using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images, together with ML techniques, for mapping not only the distribution of cropland, but also crop types and cropping patterns when validated at the county level. These results reveal that this methodology has benefits for monitoring and evaluating food security in Pakistan, adding to the evidence base of other studies on the use of remote sensing to identify crop types and cropping patterns in other countries.},

Remote sensing technology is widely used in desert research due to its large detection range and ability to obtain target feature information without touching objects. In order to better monitor and control desertification, the research methods on desert mobility and dune morphology in mobile deserts were reviewed. Among them, an important index to distinguish mobile and nonmobile deserts is desert vegetation coverage. The research progress of desert vegetation coverage based on visual interpretation, the nonlinear spectral model, normalized vegetation index (NDVI) fitting and plant community classification was reviewed. The loss of vegetation in the transitional zone of the desert is a contributing factor to desertification. The new technologies and applications of desert area monitoring, the remote sensing ecological index, and desert feature information extraction were introduced and analyzed. To combat desertification more accurately and effectively, the classification methods of moving dunes based on deep learning were also reviewed. It can be concluded that desertification monitoring methods are gradually becoming more accurate and adaptive, but they remain insufficient and less mature. Therefore, exploring how to apply desertification control technology more scientifically and rationally is an extremely valuable area for research.},

  abstract = {The Mongolian plateau is a hotspot of global desertification because it is heavily affected by climate change, and has a large diversity of vegetation cover across various regions and seasons. Within this arid region, it is difficult to distinguish desertified land from other land cover types using low-quality vegetation information. To address this, we analyze both the effects and the applicability of different feature space models for the extraction of desertification information with the goal of finding appropriate approaches to extract desertification data on the Mongolian plateau. First, we used Landsat 8 remote sensing images to invert NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), MSAVI (modified soil adjusted vegetation index), TGSI (topsoil grain size index), and albedo (land surface albedo) data. Then, we constructed the feature space models of Albedo-NDVI, Albedo-MSAVI, and Albedo-TGSI, and compared their extraction accuracies. Our results show that the overall classification accuracies of the three models were 84.53\%, 85.60\%, and 88.27\%, respectively, indicating that the three feature space models are feasible for extracting information relating to desertification on the Mongolian plateau. Further analysis indicates that the Albedo-NDVI model is suitable for areas with a high vegetation cover or a high forest ratio, whilst the Albedo-MSAVI model is suitable for areas with relatively low vegetation cover, and the Albedo-TGSI model is suitable for areas with extremely low vegetation cover, including the widely distributed Gobi Desert and other barren areas. This study provides a technical selection reference for the investigation of desertification of different zones on the Mongolian plateau.},

This paper describes work carried out in partnership with Homeless Link (HL), a UK-based charity, in developing a data-driven approach to better connect people sleeping rough on the streets with outreach service providers. HL's platform has grown exponentially in recent years, leading to thousands of alerts per day during extreme weather events; this overwhelms the volunteer-based system they currently rely upon for the processing of alerts. In order to solve this problem, we propose a human-centered machine learning system to augment the volunteers' efforts by prioritizing alerts based on the likelihood of making a successful connection with a rough sleeper. This addresses capacity and resource limitations whilst allowing HL to quickly, effectively, and equitably process all of the alerts that they receive. Initial evaluation using historical data shows that our approach increases the rate at which rough sleepers are found following a referral by at least 15\% based on labeled data, implying a greater overall increase when the alerts with unknown outcomes are considered, and suggesting the benefit in a trial taking place over a longer period to assess the models in practice. The discussion and modeling process is done with careful considerations of ethics, transparency, and explainability due to the sensitive nature of the data involved and the vulnerability of the people that are affected.},

This study was carried out in São Paulo State which is the major sugarcane producer in Brazil, occupying more than 3.1 million hectares. Cloud‐free MODIS images (16 days mosaics) were acquired over a period of almost 15 months. Samples of sugarcane and non‐sugarcane were randomly selected and cluster analysis was performed to establish similar EVI temporal behaviour clusters. It was observed that EVI was sensitive to variations in land‐use cover mainly due to phenology and land management practices. Therefore, selection of sugarcane samples with similar EVI temporal behaviour for supervised classification was difficult due to both large planting and large harvesting periods. Consequently, cluster analysis was chosen to carry out an unsupervised classification. The best results were obtained in regions occupied by: natural and planted forest, soybean, peanuts, water bodies and urban areas which contrasted with the temporal‐spectral behaviour of sugarcane. The lowest performance was observed mainly in regions dominated by pasture, which has similar temporal‐spectral behaviour to sugarcane. This study provided useful information to define a MODIS image classification procedure for sugarcane crop for the whole State area based on the large amount of cloud‐free MODIS images when compared with other currently available optical sensors.},

  abstract = {Globally, the area of agricultural land is shrinking in part due to environmental degradation. Acquisition and restoration of degraded lands no longer used for agriculture may present a major conservation opportunity with minimal social and political opposition. The ability to efficiently and accurately identify these lands from regional to global scales will aid conservation management, ultimately enhancing the global prospects of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Remote Sensing provides a potential tool to identify areas where surface property changes can be mapped and linked with land degradation. In this study, we begin to tackle a small section of this challenge by presenting novel approach to mapping changes in vegetation cover amounts at the pixel level (30\,m), using Google Earth Engine (GEE). We illustrate our approach across large-scale rangelands in Queensland Australia, using three decades of Landsat satellite imagery (1988–2017) along with field observations of land condition scores for validation. The approach used an existing method for dynamic reference cover to remove the rainfall variability and focused on the human management effects on the vegetation cover changes. Results showed the identified vegetation cover changes could be categorized into five classes of decrease, increase or stable cover compared with a set reference level, which was obtained from locations of the most persistent ground cover across all dry years. In total, vegetation cover decrease was observed in 20\% of our study area, with similar portion of lands recovering and the rest (\textasciitilde 60\%) staying stable. The lands with decrease in vegetation cover, covering a considerable area of \textasciitilde 2\,×\,105\,km2, exhibited a markedly reduced resilience to droughts. The accuracy assessment yielded an overall classification accuracy of 82.6\% (±3.32 standard error) with 75.0\% (±5.16\%) and 70.0\% (±4.13\%) producer's and user's accuracy for areas experiencing a significant decrease in vegetation cover, respectively. Identifying areas of degraded land will require multiple stages of spatial data analysis and this work provided the first stage for identifying vegetation cover changes in large-scale rangeland environment, and provides a platform for future research and development to identify degraded lands and their utility for achieving conservation endeavours.},

  abstract = {The transitional characteristics of desert grasslands in the Sahel determine the ecosystem’s fragility, which is extremely susceptible to the expansion and reversal of land desertification under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Accordingly, monitoring desertification dynamics is essential to combat this process. Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, this study analysed the applicability of different feature space models to monitor desertification levels in the Sahel from 2000 to 2020, revealing the optimal monitoring model, analysing the spatiotemporal changes and primary driving factors. The results were as follows: In the Sahel, the albedo-modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) based on the point-to-point model is the best for desertification monitoring, with an overall accuracy of 86.78\%. Generally, the level of desertification was reduced from 2000 to 2020, the area of extremely severe desertification decreased by retreating northward; and the areas of light, moderate, and severe desertification increased slowly by expanding northward. Light, moderate, and severe desertification lands were more sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic activities, undergoing greater change intensity. Precipitation was the most influential factor determining the spatial distribution of desertification in the Sahel, with anthropogenic activities also having a significant effect on the desertification level. This study comprehensively analysed desertification patterns in the Sahel and identified the primary driving factors, which are essential to inform Sahelian desertification control mechanisms in the future.},

This approach is capable of modeling the characteristics of multiple spectral signatures within each species using an internally unsupervised engine, and is able to catch spectral differences between species using an externally supervised system. To generate a species-level map for an urban forest with high spatial heterogeneity and species diversity, we conducted a treetop-based species identification. This can avoid the problems of double-sided illumination, shadow, and mixed pixels, encountered in the crown-based species classification. The study indicates lidar data in conjunction with hyperspectral imagery are not only capable of detecting individual trees and estimating their tree metrics, but also identifying their species types using the developed algorithm. The integration of these two data sources has great potential to take the place of traditional field surveys. © 2012 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric correction (AC) plays a critical role in the preprocessing of remote sensing images. Although AC is necessary for applications based on remote sensing inversion, it is not always required for those based on remote sensing classification. Recently, remote sensing statistical inference has been proposed for evaluating water quality. However, input data for these models have always been remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), which requires AC. This raises the question of whether AC is necessary for remote sensing statistical inference. We conducted a theoretical analysis and image validations by testing 24 water bodies observed by Landsat-8 and compared their spectral probability distributions (SPDs) calculated from Rrs before and after AC (using the ACOLITE model). Additionally, we tested and found that, if we use remote sensing inference as a tool to quantitatively infer statistical parameters of a specific waterbody, it is better to perform atmospheric correction. However, if the quantitative inference is applied to a large number of water bodies and high inference accuracy is not required, atmospheric correction may not be necessary, and a quick calculation based on the strong correlations between Rrs at the surface and sensor-observed reflectance can be used as a substitute.},

Over the last decade, a growing community of open-source investigative experts, environmentalists, academics and civil society groups have applied these methods to document war crimes, human rights violations and environmental degradation. These developments have created new opportunities for building accountability and transparency. The wealth of data on conflict-linked environmental damage has already been successfully leveraged to address acute and long-term environmental health risks and inform humanitarian response and post-conflict environmental assessments in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine. There are, however, larger questions on how to best make use of these data streams and information layers, and how to navigate the opportunities and limitations of these developments. This article will outline the new developments in this field and provide recommendations to ensure that data is used responsibly and effectively to strengthen accountability for environmental damages as a result of armed conflict.},
