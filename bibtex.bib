  abstract = {An estimated 2.5–5 billion single-use coffee cups are disposed of annually in the UK, most of which consist of paper with a plastic lining. Due to the difficulty of recycling poly-coated material, most of these cups end up incinerated or put in landfills. As drinking (take-away) hot beverages is a behaviour, behaviour change interventions are necessary to reduce the environmental impacts of single-use coffee cup waste. Basing the design of interventions on a theoretical understanding of behaviour increases the transparency of the development process, the likelihood that the desired changes in behaviour will occur and the potential to synthesise findings across studies. The present paper presents a methodology for identifying influences on using single-use and reusable cups as a basis for designing intervention strategies. Two behaviour change frameworks: The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COMB) model of behaviour, were used to develop an online survey and follow-up interviews. Research findings can inform the selection of intervention strategies using a third framework, the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). The application of the methodology is illustrated in relation to understanding barriers and enablers to single-use and reusable cup use across the setting of a London university campus. We have developed a detailed method for identifying behavioural influences relevant to pro-environmental behaviours, together with practical guidance for each step and a worked example. Benefits of this work include it providing guidance on developing study materials and collecting and analysing data. We offer this methodology to the intervention development and implementation community to assist in the application of behaviour change theory to interventions.},

  abstract = {Abst r a ct The direct correlation between NASA MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products and the air pollution index (API) in Beijing was found relatively low based on the long-term comparison analysis. The correlation improved to some extent after taking account of the seasonal variation of scale height and the vertical distribution of aerosols. The correlation coefficient further improved significantly after considering the influencing factor of Relative Humidity (RH). This study concluded that satellite remote-sensing could serve as an efficient tool for monitoring the spatial distribution of particulate pollutants on the ground-level, as long as corrections have been made in the two aforementioned processes. Taking advantage of the MODIS information, we analyzed a pollution episode occurring in October 2004 in Beijing. It indicated that satellite remote-sensing could describe the formation process of the ground-level pollution episode in detail, and showed that regional transport and the topography were crucial factors to air quality in Beijing. The annual averaged distribution in the urban area of Beijing and its surroundings could be also obtained from the high-resolution retrieval results, implicating that high-resolution satellite remote-sensing might be potential in monitoring the source distribution of particulate pollutants.},

  author = {Colditz, Rene},
  date = {2008-01-22},
  abstract = {Processes of the Earths surface occur at different scales of time and intensity. Climate in particular determines the activity and seasonal development of vegetation. These dynamics are predominantly driven by temperature in the humid mid-latitudes and by the availability of water in semi-arid regions. Human activities are a modifying parameter for many ecosystems and can become the prime force in well-developed regions with an intensively managed environment. Accounting for these dynamics, i.e. seasonal dynamics of ecosystems and short- to long-term changes in land-cover composition, requires multiple measurements in time. With respect to the characterization of the Earth surface and its transformation due to global warming and human-induced global change, there is a need for appropriate data and methods to determine the activity of vegetation and the change of land cover. Space-borne remote sensing is capable of monitoring the activity and development of vegetation as well as changes of the land surface. In many instances, satellite images are the only means to comprehensively assess the surface characteristics of large areas. A high temporal frequency of image acquisition, forming a time series of satellite data, can be employed for mapping the development of vegetation in space and time. Time series allow for detecting and assessing changes and multi-year transformation processes of high and low intensity, or even abrupt events such as fire and flooding. The operational processing of satellite data and automated information-extraction techniques are the basis for consistent and continuous long-term product generation. This provides the potential for directly using remote-sensing data and products for analyzing the land surface in relation to global warming and global change, including deforestation and land transformation. This study aims at the development of an advanced approach to time-series generation using data-quality indicators. A second goal focuses on the application of time series for automated land-cover classification and update, using fractional cover estimates to accommodate for the comparatively coarse spatial resolution. Requirements of this study are the robustness and high accuracy of the approaches as well as the full transferability to other regions and datasets. In this respect, the developments of this study form a methodological framework, which can be filled with appropriate modules for a specific sensor and application. In order to attain the first goal, time-series compilation, a stand-alone software application called TiSeG (Time Series Generator) has been developed. TiSeG evaluates the pixel-level quality indicators provided with each MODIS land product. It computes two important data-availability indicators, the number of invalid pixels and the maximum gap length. Both indices are visualized in time and space, indicating the feasibility of temporal interpolation. The level of desired data quality can be modified spatially and temporally to account for distinct environments in a larger study area and for seasonal differences. Pixels regarded as invalid are either masked or interpolated with spatial or temporal techniques. Prozesse an der Erdoberfläche finden auf verschiedenen Intensitätsskalen und in unterschiedlichen Zeiträumen statt. Dabei steuert das Klima die saisonale Aktivität der Vegetation, welche in den humiden Mittelbreiten hauptsächlich durch die Temperatur bestimmt wird. In semi-ariden Gebieten hingegen ist die Verfügbarkeit von Wasser als Haupteinflussfaktor für das Pflanzenwachstum zu betrachten. Andererseits greift auch der Mensch modifizierend in das Ökosystem ein. Dies gilt insbesondere für die stark besiedelten und intensiver genutzten Räume der Erde, in denen die Umwelt nahezu ausschließlich durch den Menschen gesteuert wird. Zur Beurteilung dieser Dynamiken, sowohl der natürlichen saisonalen Muster als auch der kurz- bis langfristigen Änderungen der Landschaft, ist die Aufnahme einer Vielzahl von Messungen über eine längere Periode erforderlich. Insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit der Charakterisierung der Landoberfläche und deren Veränderung im Rahmen der Erderwärmung aber auch des wachsenden Einflusses des Menschen auf die Umwelt besteht somit ein Bedarf an geeigneten Daten und Methoden zur Bestimmung der jährlichen Aktivität von Vegetationseinheiten und der wiederholbaren Kartierung der Landoberfläche. Die Satellitenfernerkundung ist in der Lage, durch Messung von Strahlung die Aktivität der Vegetation zu bestimmen sowie die Klassifikation der Landoberfläche abzuleiten. In vielen Fällen sind Satellitenaufnahmen die einzige Möglichkeit, große Flächen der Erde umfassend und einheitlich zu beurteilen. Dabei kann durch eine Vielzahl aufeinander folgender Aufnahmen, d.h. eine Zeitreihe aus Satellitendaten, die Entwicklung der Vegetation in Raum und Zeit beobachtet werden. Zeitreihen bieten das Potential, Veränderungen der Landoberfläche über mehrere Jahre zu dokumentieren und somit Prozesse sowohl hoher als auch niedriger Intensität abzuleiten. Neben diesen gerichteten Veränderungen können auch plötzliche Ereignisse, wie z.B. Hochwasser oder Brände, mit Zeitreihen erfasst und in Bezug auf normale Bedingungen ausgewertet werden. Insbesondere die operationelle Prozessierung der Satellitendaten und die automatisierte Ableitung von Informationen bilden die Basis für konsistente und kontinuierliche Produkte über längere Zeiträume. Somit besteht das Potential, die Ergebnisse direkt in die Erforschung der Landoberfläche und deren Veränderung, z.B. durch die Erderwärmung, Walddegradation, oder die Nutzung vormals natürlicher Flächen, einzubinden. Diese Dissertation befasst sich mit der Entwicklung von Methoden zur Zeitreihengenerierung unter Verwendung der Qualitätsindikatoren einzelner Aufnahmen. Ein zweites Ziel der Arbeit ist die Anwendung der optimierten Zeitreihen zur automatisierten und reproduzierbaren Kartierung der Landoberfläche, wobei unscharfe Klassifikationsverfahren zur genaueren Charakterisierung der räumlich nur grob aufgelösten Daten eingesetzt werden. Damit erfordert diese Arbeit sowohl Robustheit der eingesetzten Methoden als auch eine hohe Genauigkeit der Ergebnisse. Ebenso maßgeblich ist die Übertragbarkeit der Verfahren, einerseits auf verschiedene Regionen als auch auf verschiedene Datensätze. Daher sind die hier vorgenommenen Entwicklungen als ein Rahmen zu verstehen, der je nach Sensor oder Anwendung mit verschiedenen Modulen besetzt werden kann. Zum Erreichen des ersten Zieles, der Zeitreihengenerierung, wurde das eigenständige Softwareprodukt TiSeG (Time Series Generator) entwickelt. TiSeG dient der Auswertung der Qualitätsindikatoren die mit jedem MODIS-Produkt für terrestrische Applikationen zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Dabei werden in Bezug auf die Generierung von Zeitreihen zwei Indizes der Datenverfügbarkeit ermittelt: erstens die Anzahl der ungültigen Pixel und zweitens die längste zeitliche Datenlücke. Beide Indizes werden räumlich und zeitlich dargestellt und geben so dem Bearbeiter die Information, ob mit den aktuellen Qualitätsangaben die Generierung einer sinnvollen Zeitreihe durch zeitliche Dateninterpolation möglich ist. Die Qualitätseinstellungen können sowohl zeitlich als auch räumlich angepasst werden. Eine zeitliche Änderung kann beispielsweise für bestimmte Jahreszeiten sinnvoll sein. Räumlich unterschiedliche Qualitätseinstellungen eignen sich für größere Untersuchungsgebiete mit differenzierten physisch-geographischen Charakteristika. Als ungültig betrachtete Pixel können durch einen Fehlwert maskiert oder durch zeitliche und räumliche Interpolation neu errechnet werden. Das zweite Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die automatische Klassifikation von Zeitreihen. Hierzu wurde ein modulares Verfahren der überwachten Klassifikation entwickelt. Aufgrund der groben räumlichen Auflösung von MODIS-Daten erschien es besonders wichtig, ein unscharfes Verfahren aufzubauen, das die Heterogenität der Klassen in vielen Räumen besser abbilden kann. Dabei wurde der Klassenanteil eines jeden Pixel ermittelt. Die Schlüsselmodule zur erfolgreichen Durchführung der Klassifikation waren eine Multiskalenanalyse und die geeignete Auswahl von Merkmalen und Stichproben zum Trainieren des Klassifikators. Der eigentliche Klassifikationsschritt wurde durch eine Erweiterung des Entscheidungsbaumklassifikators durchgeführt. Diese Erweiterung kann in den bestehenden Rahmen von random forest und bagging (ein Akronym für bootstrap aggregation) eingeordnet werden. Jedoch wurden die dort angewendeten Verfahren in dieser Arbeit zu einem deutlich strategischen Vorgehen modifiziert, d.h. es wurde auf das Prinzip der Zufallsauswahl und der Wiederverwendung von Stichproben (Ziehen mit Zurücklegen) verzichtet. In Bezug auf die anfangs geschilderten Anforderungen, Robustheit, Genauigkeit und Übertragbarkeit, kann an dieser Stelle festgestellt werden, dass sich die in dieser Arbeit entwickelten Methodiken als geeignet erwiesen haben. Insbesondere die Übertragbarkeit auf andere Regionen und Daten war eine große Herausforderung, da hierdurch kein zusätzliches a priori Wissen außer den Trainingsdaten zum überwachten Klassifizieren benutzt werden konnte. Die regionale Übertragbarkeit ist für mehrere Untersuchungsräume mit sehr unterschiedlichen physisch-geographischen Eigenschaften demonstriert worden. Obwohl TiSeG derzeit nicht direkt auf andere Datensätze außer MODIS angewendet wird, bildet die zugrunde liegende Idee der Auswertung von Qualitätsdaten zur Zeitreihengenerierung sowie der entwickelte Rahmen der Software die Möglichkeit der Erweiterung, z.B. auf Daten von MERIS und auf das zukünftige VIIRS-Instrument. Des Weiteren ist das grundlegende Konzept der Qualitätsauswertung in einem separaten Prozessor für AVHRR NDVI Daten zu einem vollautomatischen, schrittweise interpolierenden Verfahren erweitert worden. Das in dieser Arbeit vorgestellte modulare Klassifikationsverfahren erfordert keine besonderen Eingangsdaten, wie z.B. bestimmte MODIS Zeitreihen. Dies wurde durch den Gebrauch unterschiedlicher Eingangsdaten zur Generierung der Maßzahlen bei der Sensitivitätsanalyse bestätigt. Damit ist der Prozess weder auf MODIS-Zeitserien noch auf Zeitreihen generell beschränkt. Der gesamte automatische Klassifikationsprozess ist datengesteuert, sowohl was die zu klassifizierenden Daten als auch die Trainingsdaten angeht. Die Unschärfe in den Ergebnissen ermöglicht die detaillierte Auswertung der Klassenzusammensetzung, was ein besonders wichtiger Aspekt bei grob aufgelösten Datenprodukten und deren Anpassungsfähigkeit auf andere Anwendungen ist.}

  abstract = {Accurate land surface reflectance plays an important role in the accurate inversion of surface parameters, and atmospheric correction plays a decisive role in obtaining accurate reflectance. For GF-1 WFV and GF-6 WFV images, there are two major issues to be addressed, including the spectral differences between nadir with far off-nadir pixels and the spatial variability of atmospheric components for wide imaging. Therefore, this study focuses on these two issues using the Sensor Invariant Atmospheric Correction (SIAC) method. Our results reveal that the SIAC approach improves the correlation accuracy from 0.8868 to 0.9173 for GF-1 WFV image compared with Sentinel-2 reflectance, from 0.9530 to 0.9620 for GF-6 WFV image compared with the results using FLAASH model. For alleviating wide-swathed anisotropy, the directional imaging angle is calculated with the result ranging from 5.6450° to 33.7497°. Furthermore, the atmospheric components have been inversed pixel by pixel with obvious spatial variation. And the correlation of inversed aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and total column water vapor (TCWV) with a spatial resolution of 500~m TCWV with measured results of AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) observation stations are 0.9175 and 0.4442, respectively. These results reveal that the atmospheric correction method works well, which is effective for the wide swath of Chinese GF-1 WFV and GF-6 WFV images on land.},

  abstract = {Explicitly identifying the desertification changes and causes has been a hot issue of eco-environment sustainable development in the China–Mongolia–Russia Economic Corridor (CMREC) area. In this paper, the desertification change patterns between 2000 and 2015 were identified by operating the classification and regression tree (CART) method with multisource remote sensing datasets on Google Earth Engine (GEE), which has the higher overall accuracy (85\%) than three other methods, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and Albedo-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) models. A contribution index of climate change and human activities on desertification was introduced to quantitatively explicate the driving mechanisms of desertification change based on the temporal datasets and net primary productivity (NPP). The results show that the area of slight desertification land had increased from 719,700 km2 to 948,000 km2 between 2000 and 2015. The area of severe desertification land decreased from 82,400 km2 to 71,200 km2. The area of desertification increased by 9.68\%, in which 69.68\% was mainly caused by human activities. Climate change and human activities accounted for 68.8\% and 27.36\%, respectively, in the area of desertification restoration. In general, the degree of desertification showed a decreasing trend, and climate change was the major driving factor in the CMREC area between 2000 and 2015.},

  abstract = {The Center for Space Research (CSR), in conjunction with the Monitoring Operations Division (MOD) of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), is evaluating the use of remotely sensed satellite data to assist in monitoring and predicting air quality in Texas. The challenges of meeting air quality standards established by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) are impacted by the transport of pollution into Texas that originates from outside our borders and are cumulative with those generated by local sources. In an attempt to quantify the concentrations of all pollution sources, MOD has installed ground-based monitoring stations in rural regions along the Texas geographic boundaries including the Gulf coast, as well as urban regions that are the predominant sources of domestic pollution. However, analysis of time-lapse GOES satellite imagery at MOD, clearly demonstrates the shortcomings of using only ground-based observations for monitoring air quality across Texas. These shortcomings include the vastness of State borders, that can only be monitored with a large number of ground-based sensors, and gradients in pollution concentration that depend upon the location of the point source, the meteorology governing its transport to Texas, and its diffusion across the region. With the launch of NASA's MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the transport of aerosol-borne pollutants can now be monitored over land and ocean surfaces. Thus, CSR and MOD personnel have applied MODIS data to several classes of pollution that routinely impact Texas air quality. Results demonstrate MODIS data and products can detect and track the migration of pollutants. This paper presents one case study in which continental haze from the northeast moved into the region and subsequently required health advisories to be issued for 150 counties in Texas. It is concluded that MODIS provides the basis for developing advanced data products that will, when used in conjunction with ground-based observations, create a cost-effective and accurate pollution monitoring system for the entire state of Texas.},

  abstract = {Ocean colour (OC) remote sensing is important for monitoring marine ecosystems. However, inverting the OC signal from the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance measured by satellite sensors remains a challenge as the retrieval accuracy is highly dependent on the performance of the atmospheric correction as well as sensor calibration. In this study, the performances of four atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms, the Atmospheric and Radiometric Correction of Satellite Imagery (ARCSI), Atmospheric Correction for OLI ‘lite’ (ACOLITE), Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance (LSR) Climate Data Record (Landsat CDR), herein referred to as LaSRC (Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Code), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), implemented for Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, were evaluated. The OLI-derived remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) products (also known as Level-2 products) were tested against near-simultaneous in-situ data acquired from the OC component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC). Analyses of the match-ups revealed that generic atmospheric correction methods (i.e., ARCSI and LaSRC), which perform reasonably well over land, provide inaccurate Level-2 products over coastal waters, in particular, in the blue bands. Between water-specific AC methods (i.e., SeaDAS and ACOLITE), SeaDAS was found to perform better over complex waters with root-mean-square error (RMSE) varying from 0.0013 to 0.0005 sr−1 for the 443 and 655 nm channels, respectively. An assessment of the effects of dominant environmental variables revealed AC retrieval errors were influenced by the solar zenith angle and wind speed for ACOLITE and SeaDAS in the 443 and 482 nm channels. Recognizing that the AERONET-OC sites are not representative of inland waters, extensive research and analyses are required to further evaluate the performance of various AC methods for high-resolution imagers like Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 under a broad range of aquatic/atmospheric conditions.},

  abstract = {Desertification is a serious ecological, environmental, and socio-economic threat to the world, and there is a pressing need to develop a reasonable and reproducible method to assess it at different scales. In this paper, the Hogno Khaan protected area in Mongolia was selected as the study area, and a quantitative method for assessing land cover change and desertification assessment was developed using Landsat TM/ETM+ data on a local scale. In this method, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), TGSI (Topsoil Grain Size Index), and land surface albedo were selected as indicators for representing land surface conditions from vegetation biomass, landscape pattern, and micrometeorology. A Decision Tree (DT) approach was used to assess the land cover change and desertification of the Hogno Khaan protected area in 1990, 2002, and 2011. Our analysis showed no correlation between NDVI and albedo or TGSI but high correlation between TGSI and albedo. Strong correlations (0.77–0.92) between TGSI and albedo were found in the non-desertification areas. The TGSI was less strongly correlated with albedo in the low and non desertification areas, at 0.70 and 0.92; respectively. The desertification of the study area is increasing each year; in the desertification map for 1990–2002, there is a decrease in areas of zero and low desertification, and an increase in areas of high and severe desertification. From 2002 to 2011, areas of non desertification increased significantly, with areas of severe desertification also exhibiting increase, while areas of medium and high desertification demonstrated little change.},

  abstract = {Properties of multi-temporal ERS-1/2 tandem coherence in boreal forests and retrieval accuracy of forest stem volume have been investigated mostly for small, managed forest areas. The clear seasonal trends and the high accuracy of the retrieval are therefore valid for specific types of forest and question is if these findings extend to large areas with different forest types in a similar manner. Using multi-temporal ERS-1/2 coherence data and extensive sets of inventory data at stand level at seven forest compartments in Central Siberia we confirm that the trend of coherence as a function of stem volume is mainly driven by the environmental conditions at acquisition. In addition, we have now found that the variability of the coherence for a given stem volume are due to spatial variations of the environmental conditions, strong topography (slope{$>$}10°), small stand size ({$<$}3–4~ha) and low relative stocking ({$<$}50\%). Further deviations can be related to errors in the ground data. Stem volume retrieval behaves consistently under stable winter frozen conditions. For stands larger than 3–4~ha and relative stocking of at least 50\%, a relative RMSE of 20–25\% can be considered the effective retrieval error achievable in Siberian boreal forest. Combined with previous experience from managed test forests in Sweden and Finland, C-band ERS-1/2 tandem coherence observations acquired under stable winter conditions with a snow cover and an at least moderate breeze can be considered so far the most suitable spaceborne remote sensing observable for the estimation of forest stem volume in homogeneous forest stands throughout the boreal zone.},

  abstract = {The availability and accessibility of multispectral and radar satellite remote sensing (SRS) imagery are at an unprecedented high. These data have both become standard source of information for investigating species ecology and ecosystems structure, composition and function at large scales. Since they capture complementary aspects of the Earth's surface, synergies between these two types of imagery have the potential to greatly expand research and monitoring opportunities. However, despite the benefits of combining multispectral and radar SRS data, data fusion techniques, including image fusion, are not commonly used in biodiversity monitoring, ecology and conservation. To help close this application gap, we provide for the first time an overview of the most common SRS data fusion techniques, discussing their benefits and drawbacks, and pull together case studies illustrating the added value for biodiversity research and monitoring. Integrating and fusing multispectral and radar images can significantly improve our ability to assess the distribution as well as the horizontal and vertical structure of ecosystems. Additionally, SRS data fusion has the potential to increase opportunities for mapping species distribution and community composition, as well as for monitoring threats to biodiversity. Uptake of these techniques will benefit from more effective collaboration between remote sensing and biodiversity experts, making the reporting of methodologies more transparent, expanding SRS image processing capacity and promoting widespread open access to satellite imagery. In the context of a global biodiversity crisis, being able to track subtle changes in the biosphere across adequate spatial and temporal extents and resolutions is crucial. By making key parameter estimates derived from SRS data more accurate, SRS data fusion promises to become a powerful tool to help address current monitoring needs, and could support the development of essential biodiversity variables.},

It takes 16 days for the swaths to overlap enough to image the whole Earth.Previous Landsat sensors swept back and forth across the swath like a whisk broom to collect data. The sensor looked at a calibration source at the end of every row, which means that measurements were consistent from orbit to orbit. But this sensor design requires fast-moving parts, which are more likely to break.—and which did on Landsat 7.In contrast, the instruments on Landsat 8 view across the entire swath at once, building strips of data like a pushbroom. This approach requires no moving parts and gives the sensor detectors greater dwell time. The pushbroom instrument is smaller and lighter than previous whisk broom instruments, but its calibration is much more complex given the large number of detectors.“It was a natural step to evolve to a pushbroom sensor. The technology was proven on other satellites, and we knew we could get better accuracy. The pushbroom has no moving parts. It is a newer and more reliable technology.” explains Terry Arvidson, senior project engineer.For more information on the future of Landsat instruments, read https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-9/instruments/. ||},

  abstract = {This paper presents a feasibility study using multi‐temporal Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to classify sugarcane crop. This study was carried out in São Paulo State which is the major sugarcane producer in Brazil, occupying more than 3.1 million hectares. Cloud‐free MODIS images (16 days mosaics) were acquired over a period of almost 15 months. Samples of sugarcane and non‐sugarcane were randomly selected and cluster analysis was performed to establish similar EVI temporal behaviour clusters. It was observed that EVI was sensitive to variations in land‐use cover mainly due to phenology and land management practices. Therefore, selection of sugarcane samples with similar EVI temporal behaviour for supervised classification was difficult due to both large planting and large harvesting periods. Consequently, cluster analysis was chosen to carry out an unsupervised classification. The best results were obtained in regions occupied by: natural and planted forest, soybean, peanuts, water bodies and urban areas which contrasted with the temporal‐spectral behaviour of sugarcane. The lowest performance was observed mainly in regions dominated by pasture, which has similar temporal‐spectral behaviour to sugarcane. This study provided useful information to define a MODIS image classification procedure for sugarcane crop for the whole State area based on the large amount of cloud‐free MODIS images when compared with other currently available optical sensors.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric correction (AC) plays a critical role in the preprocessing of remote sensing images. Although AC is necessary for applications based on remote sensing inversion, it is not always required for those based on remote sensing classification. Recently, remote sensing statistical inference has been proposed for evaluating water quality. However, input data for these models have always been remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), which requires AC. This raises the question of whether AC is necessary for remote sensing statistical inference. We conducted a theoretical analysis and image validations by testing 24 water bodies observed by Landsat-8 and compared their spectral probability distributions (SPDs) calculated from Rrs before and after AC (using the ACOLITE model). Additionally, we tested and found that, if we use remote sensing inference as a tool to quantitatively infer statistical parameters of a specific waterbody, it is better to perform atmospheric correction. However, if the quantitative inference is applied to a large number of water bodies and high inference accuracy is not required, atmospheric correction may not be necessary, and a quick calculation based on the strong correlations between Rrs at the surface and sensor-observed reflectance can be used as a substitute.},
