# SUMMARY
## What is MODIS ?

* MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra (originally known as EOS AM-1) and Aqua (originally known as EOS PM-1) satellites. 

* Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon. 

* Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths. 

* Its exceptionally broad spectral range enables MODIS data to be used in studies across numerous disciplines, including vegetative health, changes in land cover and land use, oceans and ocean biology, sea surface temperature, and cloud analysis.

* It also is used extensively for monitoring fires and natural hazards along with oil spills. An important attribute of MODIS data is the availability of MODIS data products in real-time and near real-time.

# MODIS Satellite Platform

  ## Terra
  Terra explores the connections between Earth’s atmosphere, land, snow and ice, ocean, and energy balance to understand Earth’s climate and climate change and to map the impact of human activity and natural disasters on communities and ecosystems
  
  ##Aqua
  Aqua, Latin for water, is a NASA Earth Science satellite mission named for the large amount of information that the mission is collecting about the Earth's water cycle, including evaporation from the oceans, water vapor in the atmosphere, clouds,precipitation, soil moisture, sea ice, land ice, and snow cover on the land and ice. Additional variables also being measured by Aqua include radiative energy fluxes, aerosols, vegetation cover on the land, phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter in the oceans, and air, land, and water temperatures.

]
.pull-right[The MODIS instrument has been designed and developed since the Engineering Model (EM) was completed in mid-1995. Since then, two spaceflight units, the Protoflight Model (PFM) (aboard the Terra Satellite) , and the Flight Model 1 (FM1) (aboard the Aqua Satellite) have been completed and launched. Terra was launched on December 18, 1999, and Aqua was launched on May 4, 2002. The MODIS instruments — built to NASA specifications by Santa Barbara Remote Sensing — represent the finest in engineering of spaceflight hardware for remote sensing.

**Snow in the United Kingdom**

On January 17, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite acquired a false-color image of snow across the United Kingdom. In this type of image, snow appears bright blue, vegetation is electric green, water looks dark blue. Cloud usually appears white, but high, cold clouds carrying ice crystals may be tinted bright blue.
